# RayTracer
Much of the source code for this project is derived from Steve Hollasch's Ray Tracing Series,
so much of the credit belongs to him. I have simply modified some of the code to create
my own image.


I have separated the code to generate the first part of the project from the second part,
because I had to redo the code multiple times in order to fix errors I ran into.
